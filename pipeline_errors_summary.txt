PIPELINE EXECUTION ERROR SUMMARY
================================
Date: 2024-12-19
Time: Analysis completed

OVERALL STATUS: PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL
====================================
The pipeline completed most steps but encountered several issues that need attention.

CRITICAL ERRORS (Blocking Issues):
=================================

1. UNICODE ENCODING ERROR (Step 1 - NF Residual Generation)
   - Error: UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2713'
   - Location: scripts/model_fitting/generate_missing_nf_residuals.py, line 112
   - Impact: NF residual generation failed, but script continued
   - Fix: Replace Unicode checkmark character with ASCII equivalent

2. BATCH SCRIPT SYNTAX ERROR (Step 15 - Final Summary)
   - Error: Multiple 'cat', 'library', '#' commands not recognized
   - Location: run_all.bat, Step 15 Rscript command
   - Impact: Final summary generation failed
   - Fix: Fix Rscript command syntax in batch file

WARNINGS (Non-blocking but should be addressed):
===============================================

3. R PACKAGE VERSION WARNINGS
   - Multiple packages built under R version 4.3.3
   - Packages: openxlsx, quantmod, xts, zoo, TTR, tseries, rugarch, PerformanceAnalytics, FinTS, dplyr, stringr
   - Impact: Potential compatibility issues
   - Fix: Update R packages to current versions

4. DPLYR LAG FUNCTION CONFLICT
   - Warning: dplyr lag() function breaks base R's lag() function
   - Impact: May cause issues with xts objects
   - Fix: Use stats::lag() explicitly or add conflict resolution

5. PIP VERSION WARNING
   - Warning: Error checking latest version of pip
   - Impact: Minor, but indicates network/update issues
   - Fix: Update pip or check network connectivity

STEPS THAT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:
==================================

✅ Step 2: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) - Completed
✅ Step 3: GARCH Model Fitting - Completed with warnings
✅ Step 4: Residual Extraction - Completed
✅ Step 5: NF Model Training - Completed
✅ Step 6: NF Model Evaluation - Completed
✅ Step 7: Manual Engine NF-GARCH Simulation - Completed
✅ Step 8: rugarch Engine NF-GARCH Simulation - Completed
✅ Step 9: Legacy NF-GARCH Simulation - Completed
✅ Step 10: Forecasting - Completed
✅ Step 11: Forecast Evaluation - Completed
✅ Step 12: Stylized Fact Tests - Completed
✅ Step 13: VaR Backtesting - Completed
✅ Step 14: Stress Tests - Completed

STEPS THAT FAILED:
==================

❌ Step 1: NF Residual Generation - Failed due to Unicode error
❌ Step 15: Final Summary Generation - Failed due to batch script syntax

RECOMMENDED FIXES:
==================

1. IMMEDIATE FIXES:
   - Fix Unicode character in generate_missing_nf_residuals.py
   - Fix Rscript command syntax in run_all.bat Step 15

2. MEDIUM PRIORITY:
   - Update R packages to resolve version warnings
   - Add dplyr lag function conflict resolution

3. LOW PRIORITY:
   - Update pip to resolve version checking warning

FILES GENERATED:
================
Despite errors, the pipeline generated:
- GARCH model fits for all assets and models
- NF training and evaluation results
- NF-GARCH simulations for both engines
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Stress test results
- VaR backtesting results

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Apply the critical fixes
2. Re-run the pipeline to verify all steps complete successfully
3. Review generated results for quality and completeness

END OF ERROR SUMMARY
====================
